# SymbolicWeb

AJAX/Comet/reverse HTTP thing for Clojure.



## Status

Very, very alpha.



## Usage

For PHP support if that's needed:

  php-cgi -b 127.0.0.1:6666 &


Lighttpd 1.5.x (from svn/git) for the boring static content:

  /usr/local/sbin/lighttpd -f ~/clojure/src/symbolicweb/lighttpd.conf


Start swank in the SW directory:

  ~/clojure/src/symbolicweb$ lein swank


Start Emacs and connect to the now running swank using Slime, then make sure everything's loaded:

  user> (require 'symbolicweb.core)


Now start SW:

  user> (in-ns 'symbolicweb.core)
  symbolicweb.core> (-main)


Direct your browser to http://localhost.nostdal.org/sw/ and it'll show a welcome screen of sorts.

To send JS to the browser, try:

  symbolicweb.core> (add-response-chunk "alert('hi');" @*viewport*)
